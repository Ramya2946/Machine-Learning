 Cyberattacks can trigger power outages, military equipment problems, and
breaches of confidential information, i.e., medical records could be stolen if they get into
the wrong hands. Due to the great monetary worth of the data it holds, the banking
industry is particularly at risk. As the number of digital footprints of banks grows, so does
the attack surface that hackers can exploit. In this project, I detected distributed
denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks using a classification model for the prediction of the
attack.
